    <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>

     <p class="speech">There is not one.</p>

                                <p class="stage-direction">[GUIDO _starts_, _but restrains himself_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>

   <p class="speech">Nor shall be,
   While I am Duke in Padua: listen, Madam,
   Being mine own, you shall do as I will,
   And if it be my will you keep the house,
   Why then, this palace shall your prison be;
   And if it be my will you walk abroad,
   Why, you shall take the air from morn to night.</p>

    <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>

   <p class="speech">Sir, by what rightâ€”?

    <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>

   <p class="speech">Madam, my second Duchess
   Asked the same question once: her monument
   Lies in the chapel of Bartholomew,
   Wrought in red marble; very beautiful.
   Guido, your arm.  Come, gentlemen, let us go
   And spur our falcons for the mid-day chase.
   Bethink you, Madam, you are here alone.</p>

         <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit the_ DUKE _leaning on_ GUIDO, _with his Court_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESh</h6> 
                                                <p class="stage-direction">[_looking after them_]</p>

   <p class="speech">The Duke said rightly that I was alone;
   Deserted, and dishonoured, and defamed,
   Stood ever woman so alone indeed?
   Men when they woo us call us pretty children,
   Tell us we have not wit to make our lives,
   And so they mar them for us.  Did I say woo?
   We are their chattels, and their common slaves,
   Less dear than the poor hound that licks their hand,
   Less fondled than the hawk upon their wrist.
   Woo, did I say? bought rather, sold and bartered,
   Our very bodies being merchandise.
   I know it is the general lot of women,
   Each miserably mated to some man
   Wrecks her own life upon his selfishness:
   That it is general makes it not less bitter.
   I think I never heard a woman laugh,
   Laugh for pure merriment, except one woman,
   That was at night time, in the public streets.
   Poor soul, she walked with painted lips, and wore
   The mask of pleasure: I would not laugh like her;
   No, death were better.</p>

            <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ GUIDO _behind unobserved_; _the_ DUCHESS _flings herself down
                                            before a picture of the Madonna_.]</p>

   <p class="speech">O Mary mother, with your sweet pale face
   Bending between the little angel heads
   That hover round you, have you no help for me?
   Mother of God, have you no help for me?</p>
