        <h5>The Duchess of Padua</h5>
        <h6>_Room in the Duke’s Palace_</h6>
        <pre class="d">
        <b>Description:</b>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
            the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
            of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
            canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
            the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
            the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
            gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
            _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
            into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
            cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
            very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
            enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.<br>

               <p class="speech">This is the way, my lords,
               You can buy popularity nowadays.
               Oh, we are nothing if not democratic!</p>
         
                                                                <p class="stage-direction">[_To the_ DUCHESS.]</p>
         
            <p class="speech">Well, Madam,
               You spread rebellion ’midst our citizens.</p>
         
         <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
         <p class="speech"> My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,
            The right to pity, and the right to mercy.</p>
         
         <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>
         <p class="speech">So, so, you argue with me?  This is she,
            The gentle Duchess for whose hand I yielded
            Three of the fairest towns in Italy,
            Pisa, and Genoa, and Orvieto.</p>
         
         <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
         
            <p class="speech">Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter
               Brake you your word as ever.</p>
         
         <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>
            <p class="speech">You wrong us, Madam,
               There were state reasons.</p>
         
        <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
         
            <p class="speech">What state reasons are there
               For breaking holy promises to a state?</p>
         
         <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>
         
            <p class="speech">There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest
               Close to the city: when I promised Pisa
               Unto your noble and most trusting father,
               I had forgotten there was hunting there.
               At Genoa they say,
               Indeed I doubt them not, that the red mullet
               Runs larger in the harbour of that town
               Than anywhere in Italy.</p>
         
                                                   <p class="stage-direction">[_Turning to one of the Court_.]<br></p>
         
            <p class="speech">You, my lord,
               Whose gluttonous appetite is your only god,
               Could satisfy our Duchess on that point.</p>
         
        <h6 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h6>
         <p class="speech">And Orvieto?<br></p>
         
         <h6 class="name duke">DUKE</h6>
         <p class="stage-direction">[_yawning_]</p>
            <p class="speech">I cannot now recall
               Why I did not surrender Orvieto
               According to the word of my contract.
               Maybe it was because I did not choose.</p>
         
                                                      <p class="stage-direction">[_Goes over to the_ DUCHESS.]</p>
         
            <p class="speech">Why look you, Madam, you are here alone;
               ’Tis many a dusty league to your grey France,
               And even there your father barely keeps
               A hundred ragged squires for his Court.
               What hope have you, I say?  Which of these lords
               And noble gentlemen of Padua
               Stands by your side</p>
