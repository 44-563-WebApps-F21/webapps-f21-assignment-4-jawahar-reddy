        <h5>The Duchess of Padua</h5>
        <h6>_Room in the Duke’s Palace_</h6>
        <p><b>Description:</b>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
            the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
            of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
            canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
            the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
            the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
            gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
            _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
            into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
            cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
            very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
            enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.<br>

            And every Monday morn shall bread be set
            For those who lack it.
         
                                                   [_Citizens applaud and go out_.]<br>
         
         <b>FIRST CITIZEN [_going out_]</b>
         
            Why, God save the Duchess again!<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b> [_calling him back_]
            Come hither, fellow! what is your name?<br>
         
         <b>FIRST CITIZEN:</b>
         
            Dominick, sir.<br>
         
         <b>DUKE:</b>
         
            A good name!  Why were you called Dominick?<br>
         
        <b>IRST CITIZEN [_scratching his head_]</b>
            Marry, because I was born on St. George’s day.<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b>
         
            A good reason! here is a ducat for you!
            Will you not cry for me God save the Duke?<br>
         
         <b>FIRST CITIZEN [_feebly_]</b>
         
            God save the Duke.<br>
         
        <b>DUKE</b>
         
            Nay! louder, fellow, louder.<br>
         
         <b>FIRST CITIZEN [_a little louder_]</b>
         
            God save the Duke!<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b>
         
            More lustily, fellow, put more heart in it!
            Here is another ducat for you.<BR>
         
         <b>FIRST CITIZEN [_enthusiastically_]</b>
         
            God save the Duke!<br>
         
        <b>DUKE [_mockingly_]</b>
         
            Why, gentlemen, this simple fellow’s love
            Touches me much.  [_To the Citizen_, _harshly_.]
            Go!  [_Exit Citizen_, _bowing_.]
            This is the way, my lords,
            You can buy popularity nowadays.
            Oh, we are nothing if not democratic!</br>
         
                                                                [_To the_ DUCHESS.]
         
            Well, Madam,
            You spread rebellion ’midst our citizens.<br>
         
         <b>DUCHESS</b>
         
            My Lord, the poor have rights you cannot touch,
            The right to pity, and the right to mercy.<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b>
         
            So, so, you argue with me?  This is she,
            The gentle Duchess for whose hand I yielded
            Three of the fairest towns in Italy,
            Pisa, and Genoa, and Orvieto.<br>
         
         <b>DUCHESS</b>
         
            Promised, my Lord, not yielded: in that matter
            Brake you your word as ever.<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b>
            You wrong us, Madam,
            There were state reasons.<br>
         
        <b>DUCHESS</b>
         
            What state reasons are there
            For breaking holy promises to a state?<br>
         
         <b>DUKE</b>
         
            There are wild boars at Pisa in a forest
            Close to the city: when I promised Pisa
            Unto your noble and most trusting father,
            I had forgotten there was hunting there.
            At Genoa they say,
            Indeed I doubt them not, that the red mullet
            Runs larger in the harbour of that town
            Than anywhere in Italy.
         
                                                   [_Turning to one of the Court_.]<br>
         
            You, my lord,
            Whose gluttonous appetite is your only god,
            Could satisfy our Duchess on that point.<br>
         
        <b>DUCHESS</b>
         
            And Orvieto?<br>
         
         <b>DUKE [_yawning_]</b>
            I cannot now recall
            Why I did not surrender Orvieto
            According to the word of my contract.
            Maybe it was because I did not choose.<br>
         
                                                      [_Goes over to the_ DUCHESS.]
         
            Why look you, Madam, you are here alone;
            ’Tis many a dusty league to your grey France,
            And even there your father barely keeps
            A hundred ragged squires for his Court.
            What hope have you, I say?  Which of these lords
            And noble gentlemen of Padua
            Stands by your side.<br>
